#HOW TO START THIS APP
- npm install || yarn
- start up mongod
- npm run dev || yarn dev
- npm run server || yarn server
- (seeds DB with some data):
  - rename a "example.config.js" to "config.js" at the root directory.
  - you'll want to replace the pokedex url with your own link/image.  The default one won't fit the form perfectly
  - npm run seed || yarn seed
